# DRI internship challenge - Age calculator app

![Design preview for the Age calculator app coding challenge](./guidelines/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

-   View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
-   Receive validation errors if:
    -   Any field is empty when the form is submitted
    -   The day number is not between 1-31
    -   The month number is not between 1-12
    -   The date is in the future
    -   The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page (examples are attached in design directory)
-   **Bonus**:View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   **Bonus**: responsive design is not required but recommended

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself. Note that we've removed the static font files for the font weights that aren't needed for this project.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. There are two main directories in this project, first one is **guidelines directory** and second one is **react directory**.
2. read all guidelines design in **guidelines directory** carefully.
3. After you understand the requirements, Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`. Or you can use **tailwind** to make this easier (optional).
4. Happy coding!

## Submitting your solution

submit the project as a link github to the admin, Let't rock and roll :)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
